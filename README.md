## Installation

1. Download and install the latest version of [MEmu](https://www.memuplay.com/) to emulate Android.
2. Download and run the latest Windows installer for `py-clash-bot` [here](https://github.com/pyclashbot/py-clash-bot/releases/latest).

## Usage

1. Run the `py-clash-bot` shortcut on the desktop.
2. Click the start button to create a new emulator. Wait for the emulator to load.
3. `py-clash-bot` will detect that Clash Royale is not installed. You must manually install Clash Royale on the new emulator.
